# Project To-Do list

This file should be in line with the [todomd.org](https://github.com/todomd/todo.md) file format.

Most features described in this file can be found with [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) - if you are on Windows, I highly recommend using that instead of this application, as it is far more finished.

### Essential features
 - [ ] Basic run timer
 - [ ] Timer colour indications: colour the run timer differently when:
   - on the best segment
   - when ahead of PB/WR
   - when behind of PB/WR
   - run complete - personal best/world record
   - run complete - indicate if ahead or behind of PB/WR
   - timer is paused, not running, etc
 - [ ] Integration with Speedrun.com:
   - this can be done with the [speedrun.com API](https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api)...
   - ...which has multiple unofficial implementations, [including one for Python](https://github.com/blha303/srcomapi)
